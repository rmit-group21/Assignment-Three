<h3 class="font-weight-bold pb-2 mb-4">Assignment 5</h3>

<p>Students will produce up to a 5-minute video presentation on the key elements of their project idea from Assignment 3.</p>

<p>They will also be required to upload a draft highlighting script and storyboard.</p>

<p>The breakdown of marks for this assessment are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Video Content 10%</li>
  <li>Video Length 5%</li>
  <li>Video Presentation Quality 5%</li>
  <li>Note: No draft submission will result in a deduction of marks.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>This video presentation of your Project Idea is to allow you to experience other technologies and applications, express creativity, empower the group, and produce a presentation you can be proud of showing off your desired project idea.</p>

<p>This can take many forms – and is reasonably flexible in terms of creativity and delivery.</p>

<p>Examples: News Reports, Advertisements, Interviews, Investment Funding/Product Pitch, etc. They can take on a humorous or serious presentation style (while remaining interesting, informative, and professional). Filming, Stop Motion, Animation, Drawings, etc. are options for the medium - note that a simple presentation/voiceover will net low marks.</p>

<p>Not all group members (or any) need to appear in the video. The method of recording is left up to your group – you are expected to research and find a solution.</p>
