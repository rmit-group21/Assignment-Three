Jerard has worked for the past 6 years as a full time Assistant in nursing.  He clearly loves the work and people who know him say that he has the patience of a saint.  His work can be stressful though and so he enjoys playing computer games to relieve the stress and also just to pass the time.  The people he works with tell him that he should get into IT because he has a natural ability to solve problems like Printing and connection issues. Jerard is studying at RMIT where he expects to develop the skills that will be relevant to a future career in IT.
