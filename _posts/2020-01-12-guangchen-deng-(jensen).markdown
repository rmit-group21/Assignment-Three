Based on my test results, I need to work to some people who have the same character as me, then we can have better communication. For my personal, I prefer to talk and work with who I already know. From my results, I might have trouble working with who I am not like him or her. However, I will try to blend in the team and be myself. I will try my best to have good communication with every team member. I know my short know, I will work hard to solve it and try to improve myself all the time!
