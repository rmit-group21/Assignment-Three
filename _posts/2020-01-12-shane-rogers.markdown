Living in Sydney with his 3 daughters, Shane enjoys finding unconventional solutions to challenging IT problems. Along with developing his knowledge of modern computer languages he also volunteers as an AUSLAN interpreter for the deaf. His interest in IT lead him through a career spanning about 20 years where he worked for local government, the private sector and for about 10 years at Cisco Systems. Life circumstances required him to walk away from IT but he is now working towards his Bachelor of Information Technology in the hopes of being "qualified" to return to the workforce and take on a senior IT role.

<h2>Teamwork</h2>

I expect that I will be able to contribute solutions to team problems however it can be difficult for me to understand when people introduce emotional concerns into the equation. I recognise this as a shortcoming and try to allow others room to express themselves without being critical of our differences.
