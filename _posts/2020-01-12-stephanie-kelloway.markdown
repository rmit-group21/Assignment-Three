Steph lives in Brisbane with her husband and 7-year-old gold sable East German working line German Shepherd named Aris.  She collects brooches, loves both reading and musical theatre, is a massive country music fan and openly admits to being an "Elvis Presley tragic". To round things off she is also very interested in both domestic and international politics.  Her interest in IT as a long term career has become increasingly apparent while helping to improve the IT systems in her workplace.  Steph has had various roles including Corporate Receptionist, Engineering Team Administrator and Management Assistant.  She is currently working as a Land Systems & Process Advisor but her real interest lies in the areas of cloud computing, web design, communication and ethics.

<h2>Teamwork</h2>

Based on my test results, I intend to work on being more assertive when I’m working in a team, specifically I will speak up more so that my ideas and opinions are heard. I will also work on taking ownership of my ideas so that I am given the credit I deserve for my contributions. I realise that I have a talent for ensuring things run smoothly so I will continue to use this to my advantage and that for the benefit of my entire team. I will also make it known to my team members that I am a visual learner and therefore, to understand a task and complete it properly, I really need to be shown how to complete a task, rather than simply talking about it. I will also work to ensure that once I’ve completed a task, I won’t second guess myself and look for better solutions when good solutions have already been identified.
